In this thesis, we proposed a new multimodal optimization technique that aims to break down the multimodal problem into unimodal problems.

We proposed a unimodal detection technique to find potential \textit{fitness hills} in a real-valued multimodal problem 
by hierarchical clustering and Minimum Descriptioni Length.
It depicts the underlying \textit{fitness hills} better than K-Means.
Also unlike K-Means which needs to collaborate with other methods to determine the number of clusters,
our technique intrinsically detects the number of potential unimodals.

We also proposed a method to seperate the search space into smaller subspaces in order to enhance performance.
We use linear projection matrix to project the search space to a subspace with well-defined boundaries for feasible solutions.
Therefore, the algorithm only needs to search within a hypercube, constrined by $[0,1]$ in all dimensions.
This technique is perferable for algorithms that requires a box-shape boundaries.
It also creates ROIs on the original search space that isolates the unimodals.
We also use the (1+1)-ES to optimize the projection matrix so that the ROIs have minimal-overlapping, thus enhance the searching efficiency.
By cracking down the original search space into multiple non-overlapping subspace, 
alogrithms now only have to search a smaller portion of the landscape which ideally consists of only one unimodal.

Furthermore, we proposed a new Multi-armed Bandit techniques that optimize the resource allocation.

Weakness:
Potentially more NFE on unimodals and moving regions.
Sometimes still unstable.
Requires a better clustering techniques to identify underlying unimodals.


Future work:
A linkage tree attemp to create clusters.
A better way to delete arms
Non-linear transformation
