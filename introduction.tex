% Background, Motivation and Relevant work
Multimodal problems that contain more than one region or more than one local optimum are common in the real world.
{\em Rastrigin function}, a hierachical problem which is composed of a larger hill and multiple smaller hills are also well-known in real-valued optimization.
In order to tackle these multimodal problems with a limited amount of resources, 
one needs to decide how much to invest for searching a better hill, 
while still maintain enough of exploitation on each potential hill.

The difficult part is that searching for a new hill and exploiting the best hill often require opposite searching behaviors.
For a fixed amount of total evaluations, spending more time searching on one hill implies 
less attention on exploring other possible unimodals in the search space.
This is the common dilemma between {\em exploration} and {\em exploitation} for real-valued optimization algorithms.
Also, during different phases of optimization, 
the ratio between exploring new hills and exploiting the current best hill should be altered.
Exploration is more important in the beginning, while exploitation is more required in the end.
What makes this problem even harder is that in order to decrease the number of total evaluations, 
the size of the population are often limited in the real-valed optimization algorithms.
This means that as the number of hills to invest increases, the number of particles on each hill decreases.
This weakens the exploitation ability on each hill, making it less likely to identify new potential regions on each hill.

We are more interested in hierarchically decomposable problems.
With a certain amount of hints, we should be able to focus on one of the many potential hills, 
and identify when to invest more on certain hills to iteratively discover more smaller hills.
Also, we would like to only focus on some regions instead of the whole search spaces, in order to gain performance.
This requires detection of promising areas, and search space splitting techniques.
Moreover, after identifying certain interesting regions, we also need to decide how to allocate our resources.
Given the abilities described above, 
we can pay more attention on the promising regions and 
iteratively break down a difficult multimodal problem into smaller and easier unimodal problems.

% Thesis Objective
\section{Thesis Objectives}
We propose some techniques to break down multimodal problems into several unimodal problems in smaller non-overlapping subspaces.
We believe that solving one unimodal problem on a smaller subspace is easier than tackling the complete search space as a whole.
This technique can \textbf{identify potential unimodal},
\textbf{define a region of interest} to exploit, 
and \textbf{allocate resources} according to remaining evaluations.

Identifying a \textit{unimodal} depends on the sampling frequency and the underlying model.
Clustering is a common way for discovering potentail unimodals.
We adopt the hierarchical clustering technique to discover hills in the fitness landscape.
We also use weighted normal distribution as the underlying consumption for unimodal, and trim overfitting models with minimum description length.

After identifying the unimodals by clustering, we can split the search space into different regions of interest with linear projection.
We use different projection matrices to project the original search space onto several subspaces with well-defined boundaries.
We also optimize the porjection matrix so that each region would have minimum overlapping with others.
Searching in the smaller subspace enhances the probability of finding optimium.
The well-defined boundaries are also needed for some algorithms.
The projection might also rotate or shear the original search space, making some inseparable problems easier to solve.

With multiple subspace to search, we propose a new Multi-armed Bandit (MAB) technique 
that optimize the resource allocation to get the greatest probability of obtaining the global optimum.
Multi-armed Bandit algorithms are suitable for this scenario, 
since it learns models from outcomes while the actions do not change the state of the world.
When there are still plenty of evaluations left, we should prefer exploration over exploitation and search equally on all subspaces.
However, when few evaluations remain, we should focus on the current best hill 
and try to exploit it to get the best fitness with the remaining evaluations.  


\section{Roadmap}
This thesis is composed of eight chapters.

\textbf{Chapter~\ref{chapter:algos}} presents three optimization algorithms that are used for comparisons.
We introduce 
the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES),
the Standard Particle Swarm Optimization, and
the Ant Colony Optimization for Continous Domain.
These three algorithms each have different characteristics due to different underlying models.


\textbf{Chapter~\ref{chapter:clustering}} presents some clustering techniques that guides the construction of ROIs and later becomes the initial points for algorithms in each arm.  

\textbf{Chapter~\ref{chapter:projection}} first describes four basic affine transformation: translation, rotation, scaling and shearing.
Then the projective transformation and homogeneous coordinate are presented.


\textbf{Chapter~\ref{chapter:MAB}} first describes the Multi-armed Bandit Algorithm, 
followed by a brief introduction of some common MAB algorithms, including ...
Then we present our new bandit techniques.
Tranditional bandit algorithms focus on minimizing regret, while our new bandit focus on the probability of getting a rank 1 result.


\textbf{Chapter~\ref{chapter:new_bandit}} gives details of our new algorithms.
First, the framework and pseudo code are given.
Then a detailed process of initialization is given in ...
% talk about ROI, what it is, why it is important

\textbf{Chapter~\ref{chapter:conclusion}} summarizes this thesis. 
The conclusion and contributions are also given.
Some further improvements and future works are also discussed at the end.
