\section{Standard Particle Swarm Optimization}

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm. 
%The swarm intelligence family... 
It was first proposed by J. Kennedy and R. C. Eberhart in 1995~\cite{Kennedy:1995:PSO} to simulate the foraging behavior of bird flocks.
The swarm is composed of \textit{particles} that move around in a given multi-dimensional \textit{search space} to find the best solution.
Each particle updates its velocity according to its historical experience, as well as the information of the neighboring particles.
The neighborhood of a particle is a set of information links defined by the \textit{swarm topology}. %, which indicates whom informs whom.
PSO iteratively updates the swarm topology, the velocities, and the positions of each particle until the global optimum solution is found.


Throughout the years, numerous varients of PSO have been proposed to improve performance.
As a result, a \textit{standard} PSO, composed of clear principals, is needed as the baseline for comparison.
Standard PSO (SPSO) provides a well defined version that follows the common principals of PSO design.
It is intended to be a milestone with simple and clear implementation for future comparison. %, instead of the best algorithm on the market.
So far, there have been three successive versions of standard PSO: SPSO 2006, SPSO 2007, and SPSO 2011.
The underlying principals of these three algorithms are generally the same as all PSO varients.
The exact formula and implementation are slightly different due to latest theoretical progress.
A detailed description of SPSO 2011 is given in the following paragrahs.

\subsection{Initialization of the swarm}

For a search space $E$ with a given dimension $D$, $E$ is confined by a set of minimum and maximum bounds in each dimension.
The hyperparallelepid search space $E$ can be formally defined as the Euclidean product of $D$ real intervals~\cite{Clerc:2012:SPSO2011}.
\begin{displaymath}
E = \bigotimes_{d=1}^{D}[min_d, max_d]
\end{displaymath}
For each position $x$ within the multi-dimensional search space $E$, there exists a corresponding numerical value $f(x)$, i.e. \textit{fitness}.
A swarm is composed of particles, which explore different positions in the search space to find the best corresponding fitness value.
At time $t$, each particle in the swarm possesses the following vectors with $D$ coordinate:
\begin{itemize}
\item $x_i(t)$ is the \textbf{position} of the particle $i$ at time $t$.
\item $v_i(t)$ is the \textbf{velocity} of the particle $i$ at time $t$.
\item $p_i(t)$ is the \textbf{previous best position} the particle $i$ had been to, at time $t$.
\item $l_i(t)$ is best position of all the previous best positions in the \textbf{neighborhood} of particle $i$ at time $t$.
\end{itemize}

Let $U(min_d, max_d)$ be a random number drawn from a uniform distribution within $[min_d, max_d]$, 
and $N_i(t)$ be a set of neighbours of particle $i$ at time $t$ defined by the swarm topology.
In SPSO 2011~\cite{Clerc:2012:SPSO2011}, each particle is initialized with a random position and velocity defined as following:
\begin{align*}
x_i(0) &= U(min_d, max_d) \\
v_i(0) &= U(min_d - x_{i,d}(0), max_d - x_{i,d}(0)) \\
p_i(0) &= x_i(0) \\ 
l_i(0) &= argmin_{j \in N_i(0)}(f(p_j(0)))
\end{align*}


The swarm size, denoted as $S$, differs in SPSO 2006 and SPSO 2011.
In both SPSO 2006 and SPSO 2007, the initial number of particles $S$ for dimension $D$ is defined as:
\begin{displaymath}
S = 10 + \lfloor 2\sqrt{D} \rfloor,
\end{displaymath}
However, emperically, the definition of swarm size in SPSO 2006 is far from optmial swarm size~\cite{Clerc:2012:SPSO2011}.
Therefore, in SPSO 2011, the swarm size is suggested as
%The swarm size of SPSO 2011, denoted as $S$, is suggested as
\begin{displaymath}
S = 40,
\end{displaymath}
yet it can also be defined by user~\cite{Clerc:2012:SPSO2011}.


\subsection{Velocity update equations}

Velocity update equations differs in different variations of PSO, since it is the core procedure of optimization that determines the performance of PSO.
To prevent premature convergence~\cite{Clerc:2012:SPSO2011}, SPSO follows a random permutation order to update the positions of particles in the swarm.
The position of particle $i$ at time $t+1$ depends on the previous position and the current velocity:
\begin{displaymath}
x_i(t+1) = x_i(t) + v_i(t+1).
\end{displaymath}
The velocity of particle $i$ at time $t+1$ can be described as a combination of three vectors:
\begin{displaymath}
v_i(t+1) = w v_i(t) + \alpha (p_i(t) - x_i(t)) + \beta (l_i(t) - x_i(t)),
\end{displaymath}
where $w$ mimics the momemtum of the particle, and $\alpha$, $\beta$ describes how successive actions are effected by the personal previous best position and the neighborhood previous best position.

In SPSO 2006 and SPSO 2007, the velocity update equation is applied dimension by dimension as follows:
\begin{align*}
v_i(t+1) &=  w v_i(t) + U(0,c)(p_i(t) - x_i(t)) + U(0,c) (l_i(t) - x_i(t)) \\
       w &= \frac{1}{2\ln(2)} \simeq 0.721 \\
       c &= \frac{1}{2} + \ln(2) \simeq 1.193
\end{align*}


Figure~\ref{fig:SPSO_update} visualize the three main vectors in a two dimensional problem.
The first part, $v_1$, represents the influence of previous action on current velocity.
$w$ is the inertia weight that resembles the momentum, relating the next velocity to the latest velocity $v_i(t)$.
It allows \textit{exploration} by giving a tendency of expanding the search space.
The second part, $v_2$ is a random vector drawn from the parallelepid $c(p_i(t) - x_i(t))$.
$c$ is the acceleration constant and the parallelepid $c(p_i(t) - x_i(t))$ represents the effect of personnal best memory $p_i(t)$ on current decision making.
The third part, $v_3$ is a random vector drawn from the parallelepid $c(l_i(t) - x_i(t))$
The parallelepid $c(l_i(t) - x_i(t))$ mimics how the best social memory $l_i(t)$ contributes to current decision making.
The last two parts allows \textit{exploitation}, by attracting the particles near the possible optimum positions.
Therefore, the new velocity depends on the latest action, personnal best memory, and social influence.

However, the velocity update equations of SPSO 2006 depends on the system of coordinates.
The distribution of all possible next positions is more dense near the center of a $D$ dimension rectangle.
Moreover, the dimension-by-dimension updating method makes the algorithm dependent to system coordinates.
It is extremely easy to find the optimum point lying on an axis, a diagonal or the center of the coordinate.

In SPSO 2011, the velocity update equations eliminates the coordinate dependency by creating a hypersphere according to $x_i$, $p_i$ and $l_i$, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SPSO_update}.
The hypersphere is defined as:
\begin{displaymath}
H_i(G_i, ||G_i - x_i||),
\end{displaymath}
with center $G_i$ and radius $||G_i - x_i||$.
When the personal best $p_i(t)$ is not the neighborhood previous best $l_i(t)$, the center $G_i$ is defined as:
\begin{displaymath}
G_i = \frac{1}{3} (x_i + (x_i + c(p_i - x_i)) + (x_i + c(l_i - x_i))) = x_i + \frac{c}{3}(p_i + l_i - 2x_i) 
\end{displaymath}
If the personal best is the best in the neighborhood, i.e. $p_i(t) = l_i(t)$, the center $G_i$ is defined as:
\begin{displaymath}
G_i = \frac{1}{2} (x_i + (x_i + c(p_i - x_i))) = x_i + \frac{c}{2}(p_i - x_i)
\end{displaymath}
In both cases, the acceleration constant $c$ is:
\begin{displaymath}
c = \frac{1}{2} + \ln(2) \simeq 1.193
\end{displaymath}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SPSO_update}, a random sample $x^{'}_{i}$ is drawn from the hypershpere with uniform random direction and uniform radius.
\begin{displaymath}
r = U(0, ||G_i - x_i||)
\end{displaymath} 

Therefore, the velocity update equation and new position of SPSO 2011 is defined as:
\begin{align*}
v_i(t+1) &= wv_i(t) + x_{i}^{'}(t) - x_i(t) \\
x_i(t+1) &= x_i(t) + v_i(t+1) = wv_i(t) + x_{i}^{'}(t) 
\end{align*} 
where the inertia weight is also:
\begin{displaymath}
w = \frac{1}{2\ln(2)} \simeq 0.721
\end{displaymath} 


\begin{figure}[!t] \centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{SPSO_update}
\caption{(a) SPSO 2011. (b) SPSO 2006.}\label{fig:SPSO_update}
\end{figure} 

As mentioned before, the search space is defined as a hyperparallelepid with confinement $[min_d, max_d]$ in each dimension $d$.
Therefore, after calculating the new velocities and positions of particles, we have to go through confinement check to make sure all particles stay inside the search space.
There are mutliple options to handle confinement in SPSO 2011.
The following method described in~\cite{Clerc:2012:SPSO2011} treat boundary as ``wall", so that all particles bounce back with half of previous velocity after they reach the border.
For the new position $x_{i,d}(t+1)$ of particle $i$ in dimension $d$,
\begin{align*}
if (x_{i,d}(t+1) < min_d), x_{i,d}(t+1) &= min_d \\
                           v_{i,d}(t+1) &= -0.5v_{i,d}(t+1) \\
if (x_{i,d}(t+1) > min_d), x_{i,d}(t+1) &= max_d \\
                           v_{i,d}(t+1) &= -0.5v_{i,d}(t+1) \end{align*} 



\subsection{The adaptive random topology} 
The swarm topology defines ``who informs whom" to help distribute the information of optimum solution in the swarm.
The random topology adopted in SPSO 2011 is updated under two circumstances~\cite{Clerc:2012:SPSO2011}:
\begin{itemize}
\item at the very beginning
\item after an iteration with no improvement of the best known fitness value
\end{itemize}

A good topology design should follow two rules~\cite{Clerc:2007:randomTopology}:

Describe random topology and when to update topology.
The information links...  The adaptive random topology described in ~\cite{Clerc:2007:randomTopology} is formally equivalent to ``Stocastic Star".

\section{Ant Colony Optimization for Continuous Domain}

Ant Colony optimization (ACO) is first proposed by Dorigo~\cite{Dorigo:1999:ACO} to solve combinatorial optimization problems, including scheduling, routing, and timetabling.
These problems aim to find optimal \textit{combinations} or \textit{permutations} of finit sets of available components.
Inspired by the foraging behavior of natural ants, ACO mimics the pheromone deposition of ants along the trail to a food source.
The deposited pheromone, which indicates the quantity and quality of the food, creates an indirect communication among ants and enables them to find the shortest paths.
The pseudo code of ACO is given in Algorithm~\ref{algo:ACO}.
Two major procedures: \textit{solution construction} and \textit{phermone update}, are detailed in the following paragraph.


Consider a search space $\boldsymbol{S}$ defined over a finit set of all possible \textit{solution components}, denoted by $\boldsymbol{C}$.
Each solution component, denoted by $c_{ij}$, is a decision variable $X_i$ instantiated with value $v^{j}_{i} \in \boldsymbol{D}_i = \{ v^{1}_{i}, ..., v^{|\boldsymbol{D}_i|}_{i}\}$.
To construct a new solution, an artificial ants starts with an empty partial solution $s^{p} = \emptyset$.
During each construction step, the partial solution $s^{p}$ is extended with a feasible solution from the set $N(s^{p}) \in \boldsymbol{C} \setminus s^{p}$.
The probabilistic pheromone model adopted for selecting a feasible solution from $N(s^{p})$ can be defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
p(c_{ij}|s^p) = \frac{\tau^{\alpha}_{ij} \cdot \eta(c_{ij})^{\beta}} 
                     {\sum_{c_{i\ell}\in N(s^{p})} \tau^{\alpha}_{i\ell} \cdot \eta(c_{i\ell})^{\beta} },  \forall c_{ij} \in N(s^{p}),
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{ij}$ is the pheromone value associated with component $c_{ij}$, and $\eta(\cdot)$ is a weighting function. 
% that assigns at each construction step a heuristic value to each feasible solution component $c_{ij} \in N(s^{p})$.
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are positive parameters which determine the relation between phermone and heuristic information.

The pheromone update


Over the years, multiple approaches of extending the ACO on continous domain have been given.
One of the most successful version is ACO$_{R}$, proposed by Socha and Dorigo in 2008~\cite{Socha:2008:ACOR}.
It extends ACO to the continuous domain without making any major conceptual change to its structure.
The fundamental idea underlying ACO$_{R}$ is the shift from using a discrete probability distribution to using a continuous one, demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ACOR_distribution}.
